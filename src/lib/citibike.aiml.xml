<category><pattern>DO I HAVE TO WEAR A HELMET*</pattern><template>Helmets have been proven to greatly reduce the risk of head injury in an accident. In New Jersey, it is the law that cyclists under the age of 17 wear a helmet while riding. In New York, cyclists over the age of 13 are not required to wear a bike helmet, but it is always recommended for riders of all ages. </template></category>

You can also turn the seat backward on a red-lighted bike, so members can see from afar that it’s broken.</template></category>

 <category><pattern>IS IT SAFE TO RIDE BIKES IN THE CITY*</pattern><template>While there can always be risks with any mode of transportation, bike share has proven to be relatively safe. Of course, it is always recommended that riders wear helmets to greatly reduce the risk of head injury should an accident occur.</template></category>  	
 <category><pattern>MY RIDE CODE ISN'T WORKING*</pattern><template>Ok, we’ll try to help! If you’ve entered your code correctly into keypad on the dock, and the light on the dock isn’t turning green, there may be a few reasons why your ride code isn’t working:
•	The light on the dock is red → this means the bike is broken and can’t be unlocked
•	Something is wrong with the dock → occasionally, the technology on the dock may fail
•	The ride code expired → codes are only valid for 5 minutes for security purposes
If your ride code hasn’t expired, try the same code again on a different dock with an available bike. If it still isn’t working, you can request a new code from the kiosk – just insert the same credit card again to get a new ride code (don’t worry, you won’t be charged again).
